Notes made from the book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund
According to World Bank, Financial inclusion means that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way. It is considered as a key enabler to reduce extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. It is also considered as an enabler for 7 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account.

Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enables households to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other financial services. Therefore, being able to have access to a transaction account is a first step toward broader financial inclusion since a transaction account serves as a gateway to other financial services, which is why ensuring that people worldwide can have access to a transaction account is key.
